# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch 

I’ve been told ‘if you can code it you know it’. This repository contains basic ML algorithms coded from scratch and demonstrated with toy data. The purpose is to help me study for interviews. 

## File List
 * gaussian_mixture_fit.py – Fit a gaussian mixture model with expectation maximization
 * K_means_alg.py – Performs k means clustering on simulated data (k=2 only)
